This bot was created in just a few minutes. I haven't given a single fuck on code readabilty or correctness. I just works :D

Just compile with 'g++ -o test main.cpp -lX11 -lstdc++ -L/usr/X11/lib -lXtst'

To teach the bot which colors and Positions to use, start the bot (it will need the Keyboard-Input-File as parameter!) and move the mouse to the Y Position on the Screen where it should check for the platforms and press the Q-Key on your Keyboard. Next, move the mouse somewhere where the cats tail will be when the game starts and press Q. Do the same for the nose.

After that, move the mouse on a color that you want the bot to search for. Press Q to confirm. Repeat this for every color you want to have checked. Press W if you are done. The Bot will now start to emulate Space-Bar presses. Start the game and let the bot play it for you.
